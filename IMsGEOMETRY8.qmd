## TOPIC: THE MATHEMATICAL SYSTEM OF GEOMETRY

### LESSON 2: DEFINED TERMS, UNDEFINED TERMS, POSTULATRS AND THEOREMS

**Lesson Objectives:**

At the end of the lesson, the students should be able to:

-   illustrates defined terms, undefined terms, postulates and theorems; and

-   identify the postulates or theorems being referred in the given statement.

    ## What's in!

    **Recall:** Point, Line, and Plane

    **Directions:** Determine whether each of the following suggests a point, a line or a plane.

    1.  straight wire
    2.  pinhole
    3.  sheet of paper
    4.  period
    5.  stick

    ***What‚Äôs New*** Directions: Write something about the following terms using your previous learning in geometry.

    1.  Point
    2.  Line
    3.  Plane

    ***What is It***

    Points, lines, and planes are the building blocks of geometry. They are the undefined terms in geometry because they can be described without using other figures.

    The undefined terms are used to define other geometric concepts. Here are some of the defined terms formed from the undefined terms.

**Postulates and Theorems**

**Postulates** also known as axioms are statements accepted as true without proof.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| POSTULATE                                                                             | ILLUSTRATIONS                        |
+=======================================================================================+======================================+
| 1.A line and a plane contain an infinite number of points.                            |                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| 2\. Line Postulate Two points determine exactly one line.                             | ![](images/clipboard-1032678993.png) |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| 3\. Plane Postulate Three noncolinear points determine a plane.                       | ![](images/clipboard-533469961.png)  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| 4\. If two points are on a plane, then the line containing them is at the same plane. | ![](images/clipboard-2160945067.png) |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| 5\. If two planes intersect, then their intersection is a line.                       | ![](images/clipboard-1992673624.png) |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

**Theorems** are statements that need to be proven using any postulate or theorem.

**What‚Äôs More**

*Now it‚Äôs your turn!*

Answer the activity below to solidify your understanding and skills of the topic.

Activity 1.2

I. Directions: Illustrate and label the following.

1.  Line CD
2.  Point C on plane D
3.  Three non-colinear points A, B and C on plane K.
4.  Lines l and m intersect at point X.
5.  Planes P and R intersect at line AB.

<!-- -->

II. Directions: State the postulate or theorem that makes each of statement true. Refer to the postulates and theorems stated above.

Given: three non-colinear points P, Q and R.

![](images/clipboard-3356996749.png)

1.  Points P and Q lie in line segment ùëÉùëÑ.
2.  Points P, Q and R are contained in plane PQR.
3.  line segment ùëÉùëÑ lies on plane PQR.
4.  line segment ùëÉùëÑ and point R lie on plane PQR.
5.  line segment ùëÉùëÑ and line segmentùëÑùëÖintersect only at point Q.

## **What's Need To Remember**  

**Points, lines and planes are the building blocks of geometry.**

**‚Ä¢ Points**
1. A point has no length, width and space.
2. A line has infinite length but no width and thickness.
3. A plane extends infinitely in two dimensions. No thickness.
**‚Ä¢ Postulates**
1. A line and a plane contain an infinite number of points.
2. Line Postulate. Two points determine exactly one line.
3. Plane Postulate. Three noncollinear points determine a
plane.
4. If two points are on a plane, then the line containing them
is at the same plane.
5. If two planes intersect, then their intersection is a line.
**‚Ä¢ Theorems**
1. Two lines intersect at one point.
2. A line and a point not on the line determine a plane.
3. Two intersecting lines determine a plane.
4. The intersection of a line and a plane is a point.

## Assignment 

Think of a real-life situation that can represent the postulate or theorem
illustrated above. Write at least 3.
**Example:** the ground and the tripod of the camera. This illustrates the
postulate number 3 - three noncollinear points determine a plane.
